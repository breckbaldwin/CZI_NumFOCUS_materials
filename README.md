# CZI_NumFOCUS_resources

Scripts for counting research citations, PR aging, etc.. for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative proposals

At this point the scripts are pretty rough code wise. I figure it is more important to get code 
out so people can work on their proposals rather than make it all nice. 

Also, sorry that they are in R for all you Python users. I am working on my R side right now so I am learning and you will see some pretty amatueur stuff. 

You can see output at https://breckbaldwin.github.io/CZI_NumFOCUS_materials/index.html which is 
where any documentation exists.
